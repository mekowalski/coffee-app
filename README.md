# Coffee App Rails Backend/API

- `rails new app-name --api` builds a smaller rails app without a lot of frontend power that rails offers
- Now this is more of an API that doesn't deal with views

- What kind of generator to use for building models? `scaffold, resource?`
- Currently comment out actions of users#show and users#index, can figure that our later
- Routes will change with api/route

- Change namespace for routes `site.com/api/coffee/3`
